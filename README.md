## Overview 🌐

🌐 **TvNexa: Bringing the World to Your Screen! 📺**  
**TvNexa** is a personal project I developed to deepen my skills in **Android TV development**, backend integration, and **modern architecture**. The platform is built using **Jetpack Compose for TV** and **Jetpack Material 3**, with the goal of creating a seamless and consistent viewing experience across devices, including Android TV and mobile platforms.

<p align="center">
  <img width="700px" src="doc/picture_23.gif" />
</p>

The main purpose of **TvNexa** was to explore the challenges and best practices in building a **cross-platform IPTV streaming service**. Through this project, I aimed to learn how to handle real-time data streaming, manage large amounts of television content efficiently, and create a user-friendly interface that works on both TV and mobile devices.

### **Consuming TvNexa Architecture Services**  
TvNexa utilizes **TvNexa Architecture** services, which handle the backend for managing the television content seamlessly. Working on this allowed me to gain practical experience with backend technologies, **data storage**, and API integration.

### **Backend Overview**:

The backend architecture is powered by **TvNexa Architecture**. Here are some of the key technologies and concepts I worked with to ensure efficient performance and data management:

- **Quartz Jobs for EPG Integration 🕒**: I implemented **Quartz Jobs** to handle the integration of Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data, retrieving program schedules from various sources and storing them in the **MariaDB Galera cluster** for reliable and consistent access.

- **MariaDB Galera Cluster with Jetbrains Exposed 🗃️**: Using **MariaDB Galera Cluster** for data storage and **Jetbrains Exposed** as an ORM allowed me to efficiently manage data and ensure that it’s easily retrievable for serving to end users.

- **API Development with Ktor 🚀**: Developing the API layer with **Ktor** was an exciting challenge. It enabled me to efficiently retrieve data from the MariaDB Galera cluster and serve it to the frontend for a smooth user experience.

- **Redis Cluster for Caching 🔄**: To improve the performance of the app, I integrated **Redis Cluster** as a caching solution to reduce load times and enhance the speed of data retrieval.

- **Read and Write Clusters 📚🖊️**: The backend architecture is optimized with **Read and Write clusters**, where the **Read Cluster** handles user queries via the API, and the **Write Cluster** takes care of data ingestion and updates.

This backend architecture allowed me to gain valuable experience in handling the infrastructure of a real-time streaming service and managing data at scale.

## User-Focused Features 🚀

Throughout the development of **TvNexa**, my main goal was to build a platform that not only showcases my learning but also offers practical and user-friendly features. These are some of the features I implemented as part of the project:

- **User Profiles**: I added functionality for creating multiple profiles, allowing users to personalize their content and enjoy a tailored experience.
- **Parental Controls**: I integrated parental control measures, including **channel blocking**, **NSFW content filtering**, and **time-based restrictions**, ensuring the app can be safely used by all family members.
- **Favorite Channels Management**: The app allows users to manage their favorite channels, helping them easily access their most-watched content.
- **Search Functionality**: Implementing a powerful search feature made it simple for users to find specific channels quickly.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: The user interface was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, allowing easy navigation through the content.
- **Channel Categorization**: I created a system for categorizing channels by themes and countries, making browsing more convenient and structured.

### **What I Learned** 💡

This project served as an excellent opportunity to improve my skills in both **Android TV development** and **backend architecture**. I focused on applying **Clean Architecture** to maintain a scalable, testable, and maintainable codebase while using modern tools like **Jetpack Compose** for building a responsive TV UI. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with backend technologies like **MariaDB**, **Redis**, and **Ktor**, which helped me understand how to build robust, real-time systems.

The project allowed me to explore various aspects of software development, including UI/UX design, backend integration, real-time data management, and performance optimization. **TvNexa** has been a valuable learning experience

## Technical Details 🛠️

### Clean Architecture

TvNexa follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. The project is organized into layers – Presentation, Domain, and Data – to facilitate scalability and testability.

### Networking

Efficient communication with backend services is achieved through Retrofit and OkHttp.

### Video Playback

For a high-quality streaming experience, TvNexa leverages ExoPlayer. This powerful media player is integrated into the project to handle the playback of HLS IPTV content.

### Jetpack Compose for TV

The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose for TV, providing a modern and declarative UI toolkit for building native Android applications.


### MVI Architecture with Clean Architecture using Jetpack Compose

TvNexa follows a robust architectural approach combining MVI (Model-View-Intent) with Clean Architecture, empowered by Jetpack Compose. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability, making TvNexa a reliable and flexible platform for streaming content.

#### MVI Architecture:
MVI architecture revolves around three main components:

1. **Model**: Represents the data state of the application. Each screen has a unified state model observed with a StateFlow, ensuring consistency and predictability across the UI. Additionally, Side Effects events are utilized to manage asynchronous tasks and other events that may not have a direct representation in the UI, ensuring smooth operation of the application.

   
2. **View**: Renders the user interface and receives user input.
   
3. **Intent**: Represents user actions or events that trigger state changes.

By adopting the MVI pattern, TvNexa achieves a unidirectional data flow, enhancing predictability and testability while minimizing side effects.

#### Clean Architecture:
TvNexa adheres to Clean Architecture principles, which include:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions. Jetpack Compose facilitates the implementation of the presentation layer, enabling the creation of a modern and declarative UI.
   
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and use cases of the application. This layer remains independent of any frameworks or platforms, promoting reusability and testability.
   
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data retrieval and manipulation, including interactions with external services such as backend APIs. Retrofit and OkHttp facilitate efficient communication with backend services.

#### Integration with Jetpack Compose:
Jetpack Compose is utilized throughout TvNexa to build the user interface, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users. Compose's declarative approach simplifies UI development and enables rapid iteration, allowing TvNexa to adapt to evolving user needs efficiently.

#### Benefits:
- **Scalability** 📈: The combination of MVI and Clean Architecture allows TvNexa to scale smoothly as the application grows in complexity and functionality.
  
- **Maintainability** 🛠️: Clear separation of concerns facilitates easier maintenance and updates, ensuring TvNexa remains robust and reliable over time.
  
- **Flexibility** 🎨: Jetpack Compose's flexibility and adaptability empower TvNexa to deliver a tailored and immersive streaming experience to users across different devices and platforms.

By embracing MVI architecture with Clean Architecture and leveraging Jetpack Compose, TvNexa sets a high standard for online television platforms, prioritizing performance, maintainability, and user satisfaction.
