## Technical Details üõ†Ô∏è

### Clean Architecture

TvNexa follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. The project is organized into layers ‚Äì Presentation, Domain, and Data ‚Äì to facilitate scalability and testability.

### Networking

Efficient communication with backend services is achieved through Retrofit and OkHttp.

### Video Playback

For a high-quality streaming experience, TvNexa leverages ExoPlayer. This powerful media player is integrated into the project to handle the playback of HLS IPTV content.

### Jetpack Compose for TV

The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose for TV, providing a modern and declarative UI toolkit for building native Android applications.


### MVI Architecture with Clean Architecture using Jetpack Compose

TvNexa follows a robust architectural approach combining MVI (Model-View-Intent) with Clean Architecture, empowered by Jetpack Compose. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability, making TvNexa a reliable and flexible platform for streaming content.

#### MVI Architecture:
MVI architecture revolves around three main components:

1. **Model**: Represents the data state of the application. Each screen has a unified state model observed with a StateFlow, ensuring consistency and predictability across the UI. Additionally, Side Effects events are utilized to manage asynchronous tasks and other events that may not have a direct representation in the UI, ensuring smooth operation of the application.

   
2. **View**: Renders the user interface and receives user input.
   
3. **Intent**: Represents user actions or events that trigger state changes.

By adopting the MVI pattern, TvNexa achieves a unidirectional data flow, enhancing predictability and testability while minimizing side effects.

#### Clean Architecture:
TvNexa adheres to Clean Architecture principles, which include:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions. Jetpack Compose facilitates the implementation of the presentation layer, enabling the creation of a modern and declarative UI.
   
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and use cases of the application. This layer remains independent of any frameworks or platforms, promoting reusability and testability.
   
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data retrieval and manipulation, including interactions with external services such as backend APIs. Retrofit and OkHttp facilitate efficient communication with backend services.

#### Integration with Jetpack Compose:
Jetpack Compose is utilized throughout TvNexa to build the user interface, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users. Compose's declarative approach simplifies UI development and enables rapid iteration, allowing TvNexa to adapt to evolving user needs efficiently.

#### Benefits:
- **Scalability** üìà: The combination of MVI and Clean Architecture allows TvNexa to scale smoothly as the application grows in complexity and functionality.
  
- **Maintainability** üõ†Ô∏è: Clear separation of concerns facilitates easier maintenance and updates, ensuring TvNexa remains robust and reliable over time.
  
- **Flexibility** üé®: Jetpack Compose's flexibility and adaptability empower TvNexa to deliver a tailored and immersive streaming experience to users across different devices and platforms.

By embracing MVI architecture with Clean Architecture and leveraging Jetpack Compose, TvNexa sets a high standard for online television platforms, prioritizing performance, maintainability, and user satisfaction.
